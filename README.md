The M/M/1 queueing model, often referred to as the M/M/1 queue, is a basic and widely used queuing system in the field of operations research and queuing theory. 
The notation M/M/1 represents the characteristics of the model:
M: Stands for memoryless arrivals. This implies that the time between successive arrivals of customers follows an exponential probability distribution, indicating that arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate.
M: Also stands for memoryless service times. The time it takes to serve a customer follows an exponential probability distribution, indicating that service times are independent and at a constant rate.
1: Indicates a single server in the system.
